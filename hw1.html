</div>


<p>You can also download a <a href="hw1.pdf">PDF</a> copy of this homework assignment.</p>
<p>This homework assignment concerns specifying and the interpreting (via inference) linear models using data from several studies. In particular, you will see how to make inferences concerning linear combinations of model parameters. You will likely need to install several packages to access the data. These include the <strong>bootstrap</strong> and <strong>agridat</strong> packages, as well as the <strong>trtools</strong> and <strong>ggplot2</strong> packages which you should have already installed.</p>
<div id="instructions" class="section level2">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>This assignment is due by 5:00 PM on Wednesday, February 9th. Email me your homework at <a href="mailto:trjohns@uidaho.edu" class="email">trjohns@uidaho.edu</a>. If possible, save/export your homework as a PDF file. Late assignments will be penalized by 10% if turned-in within 12 hours of the deadline, and 10% more for each additional 12 hour interval.</p></li>
<li><p>Your solutions must be <strong>typed</strong> and <strong>very</strong> neatly organized. I will not try to infer your solutions if they are not clearly presented. Mathematical expressions need not be typeset perfectly but they should be clear. You may substitute letters for symbols (e.g., b1 for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>) and use other shortcuts for mathematical notation if no meaning is lost.</p></li>
<li><p>You must include with your solutions the relevant R output <strong>and</strong> R code that created them. Be sure that you provide sufficient code that I can replicate your results. Include both the code and the output within the text of your solutions (not in an appendix) using cut-and-paste. But edit your output so as to provide only that which is relevant to answering the questions. Use a monospace font (e.g., Courier or Monoco) for R code and output for clarity. Do not use a monospace font for text that is not R code or output.</p></li>
<li><p>Plots from R Studio can be exported in various formats or directly to the clipboard using the “export” menu in the top-left part of the plot panel.</p></li>
<li><p>It is permitted for you to discuss the homework with other students in the course. However your work including R code, output, and written answers must be your own.</p></li>
<li><p>You are very welcome to ask me questions. I will be happy to clarify what I am asking in any of the questions and will provide you some help with solving problems by showing you how to work through similar problems from class. I will also be open to helping with any R problems. If you email me with a R question, it will usually be helpful for you to include enough of your R script so that I can replicate your issue. But please avoid saving all your questions for just before the assignment is due. I can usually respond quickly to questions, but I will sometimes need time to respond.</p></li>

<h2>Bumpus’ Sparrows</h2>
<p>A famous <a href="https://amornithhistory.org/2018/03/05/professor-bumpus-and-his-sparrows">lecture</a> by biologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermon_Carey_Bumpus">Hermon Bumpus</a> demonstrated natural selection using data concerning the survival of house sparrows (<em>Passer domesticus</em>) after a severe winter storm.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> After the storm, moribund sparrows were brought to the Anatomical Laboratory at Brown University. Some of these sparrows were revived, but many died. All of the sparrows that were brought in were examined with respect to a variety of anatomical characteristics. It is interesting to compare the anatomical characteristics of sparrows that survived versus those that did not. Dot plots showing the distributions of humerus (upper wing bone) length in the samples of sparrows that survived and the sparrows that did not are shown below.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(trtools)
library(ggplot2)

bumpus$survived &lt;- factor(bumpus$survival, 
  levels = c(TRUE,FALSE), labels = c(&quot;yes&quot;,&quot;no&quot;))

p &lt;- ggplot(bumpus, aes(x = survived, y = humerus)) + theme_minimal() + 
  geom_dotplot(binaxis = &quot;y&quot;, binwidth = 0.001) + coord_flip() + 
  labs(x = &quot;Survived&quot;, y = &quot;Humerus Length (in)&quot;)
plot(p)</code></pre>
<p><img src="hw1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> Note that I created a new variable <code>survived</code> from the <code>survival</code> variable. This is not necessary, and you could use the original <code>survival</code> variable. I did it to change the labels to “yes” and “no”.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The following code shows how you can use the <strong>dplyr</strong> package to compute the sample means, standard deviations, and sizes for the two samples of sparrows.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
bumpus %&gt;% group_by(survived) %&gt;% 
  summarize(ybar = mean(humerus), sd = sd(humerus), n = n())</code></pre>

2 no       0.727 0.0252    64</code></pre>
<p>So the sample means for the observations of non-surviving and surviving sparrows are <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_n\)</span> = 0.727 and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}_y\)</span> = 0.736, respectively, the sample standard deviations are <span class="math inline">\(s_n\)</span> = 0.0252 and <span class="math inline">\(s_y\)</span> = 0.0203, respectively, and the sample sizes are <span class="math inline">\(n_n\)</span> = 64 and <span class="math inline">\(n_y\)</span> = 72, respectively. Note that the sample means and standard deviations are rounded.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_y\)</span> be the “population means” for humerus length for non-surviving and surviving sparrows, respectively, or what we would call the expected humerus lengths.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In an introductory statistics course you learned a variety of ways to make inferences using data like these. You learned how to compute a confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_y - \mu_n\)</span> such as <span class="math display">\[
  \bar{y}_y - \bar{y}_n \pm ts_p\sqrt{1/n_y + 1/n_n},
\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
  s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_y-1)s_y^2 + (n_n-1)s_n^2}{n_y + n_n - 2}},
\]</span> is the “pooled” estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, the standard deviation of humerus length, and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is a value from the <em>t</em>-distribution with <span class="math inline">\(n_y + n_n - 2\)</span> degrees of freedom that is used to specify the confidence level.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The test statistic for a “t-test” of the null hypothesis that <span class="math inline">\(\mu_y - \mu_n\)</span> = 0 (i.e, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_y = \mu_n\)</span>) is <span class="math display">\[
  t = \frac{\bar{y}_y - \bar{y}_n}{s_p\sqrt{1/n_y + 1/n_n}}.
\]</span> If you were to compute the confidence interval and test statistic using the formulas above you would get a confidence interval (with a 95% confidence level) for <span class="math inline">\(\mu_y - \mu_n\)</span> of approximately (0.001 in, 0.016 in) and a test statistic for the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(\mu_y - \mu_n\)</span> = 0 of approximately <em>t</em> = 2.175.

<div id="anti-inflammatory-hormone-devices" class="section level2">
<h2>Anti-Inflammatory Hormone Devices</h2>
<p>For this problem you will be using the data frame <code>hormone</code> from the <strong>bootstrap</strong> package. The data are from a fictional study of devices for delivering anti-inflammatory hormones. The primary goal of the study is compare devices from three different manufacturing lots with respect to the amount of hormone remaining in the devices after use. The plot below shows the distribution of hormone remaining for the devices from the three lots.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(bootstrap)
library(ggplot2)

p &lt;- ggplot(hormone, aes(x = Lot, y = amount)) + theme_minimal() + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + coord_flip() + labs(y = &quot;Amount Remaining&quot;)
plot(p)</code></pre>
<p><img src="hw1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> The following shows the mean for amount remaining by lot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)

hormone %&gt;% group_by(Lot) %&gt;% summarize(ybar = mean(amount))</code></pre>
<pre><code># A tibble: 3 × 2

  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
1 A      23.1
2 B      22.1
3 C      28.9</code></pre>
<p>The goal here is to make inferences about the expected amount of hormone remaining for devices from the three manufacturing lots.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Estimate a linear model using the <code>lm</code> function where the response variable is the amount of hormone remaining and the explanatory variable is lot. Report the parameter estimates and standard errors using the <code>summary</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p>The model you estimated in the previous problem can be written as <span class="math display">\[
  E(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \beta_2x_{i2},
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th observation of the amount of hormone remaining. Explain how <span class="math inline">\(x_{i1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_{i2}\)</span> are defined for this model (i.e., how would you determine their values for a given device?).

<li><p>Using the <code>contrast</code> <em>and</em> <code>lincon</code> functions, produce estimates, standard errors, and confidence intervals for the expected amount of hormone remaining for each lot. Note that the results from <code>lincon</code> and <code>contrast</code> should be the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <code>contrast</code> <em>and</em> <code>lincon</code> functions, produce estimates, standard errors, and confidence intervals for the <em>difference</em> in the expected amount of hormone remaining between lot <em>C</em> and <em>B</em>, lots <em>C</em> and <em>A</em>, and between lots <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. Note that the results from <code>lincon</code> and <code>contrast</code> should be the same.</p></li>
<li><p>The model and analyses in the previous problems fails to take into account that devices in the three lots tended to have different amounts of use as can be seen in the following.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- ggplot(hormone, aes(x = Lot, y = hrs)) + theme_minimal() + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + coord_flip() + labs(y = &quot;Hours of Use&quot;)
plot(p)</code></pre>
<p><img src="hw1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>hormone %&gt;% group_by(Lot) %&gt;% summarize(wear = mean(hrs))</code></pre>
<pre><code># A tibble: 3 × 2
  Lot    wear
  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
1 A      151.
2 B      233.
3 C      111 </code></pre>
<p>As can be seen in the plot and in the descriptive statistics, the devices from lot <em>C</em> had, on average, the least hours of use, while devices from lot <em>B</em> tended to have the most hours of use. We can view the relationship among all three variables in the following plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- ggplot(hormone, aes(x = hrs, y = amount, color = Lot)) + theme_minimal() + 
  geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Hours of Use&quot;, y = &quot;Amount of Hormone Remaining&quot;)
plot(p)</code></pre>
<p><img src="hw1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /> There is nothing statistically incorrect about the model used in the previous problem, but it may not be useful since it does not allow for a “fair” comparison between the lots since the devices in the lots differ across lots with respect to use. A more useful comparison would be to compare the expected amount of hormone between the lots while “controlling for” hours of use — i.e., what is the difference in the expected amount of hormone for devices from different lots but with the same amount of use? Estimate a linear model with amount of hormone remaining as a response variable and <em>both</em> lot and hours of use as explanatory variables. Do not include an “interaction” term in your model so that the rate of change in expected amount of hormone with respect to amount of use is the same for each lot. Report the parameter estimates and their standard errors using the <code>summary</code> function, parameter confidence intervals using the <code>confint</code> function, and plot the estimated expected amount of hormone remaining as a function of hours of use and lot by extending the code given above. Note that this will require you to create an artificial data set using the <code>expand.grid</code> function for different combinations of hours of use and lots. For the hours of use variable, have your values go from 29 to 402 hours, which are the smallest and largest values observed in the data.</p></li>
<li><p>The model you estimated in the previous problem can be written as <span class="math display">\[
  E(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \beta_2x_{i2} + \beta_3x_{i3}.
\]</span> Explain how <span class="math inline">\(x_{i1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_{i2}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x_{i3}\)</span> are defined (i.e., how would you determine their values for a given device). Then write the model case-wise to show how the expected amount of hormone remaining can be written as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span>, and hours of use for each lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <code>contrast</code> function to estimate (a) the expected amount of hormone remaining in a device from each of the three lots that has had 200 hours of use, and (b) the <em>difference</em> in the expected amount of hormone remaining between lot <em>C</em> and <em>B</em>, lots <em>C</em> and <em>A</em>, and between lots <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, when the hours of use is 200 hours. Comment briefly on how your comparisons between the lots in (b) compare to what you found earlier when you did not control for hours of use.</p></li>
<li><p>In the model used in the previous questions with hours of use as an explanatory variable with lot, one of the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span> parameters in the model is the rate of change in the expected amount of hormone remaining with respect to hours of use (i.e., the change in the expected amount of hormone remaining for a one hour increase in use). Because of how the model was specified, this is the same for the three lots. Now use the <code>contrast</code> function to estimate this same quantity for each lot. You should obtain the same estimate, standard error, confidence interval, and test statistic as for the corresponding <span class="math inline">\(\beta_j\)</span> parameters as shown by <code>summary</code> and <code>confint</code>, and these should be the same for each lot. Also use the <code>contrast</code> function to estimate the change in the expected amount of hormone remaining for a 100 hour increase in use. Note that your estimate, standard error, and confidence interval endpoints should be 100 times what you found for a one hour increase, but the test statistic should be the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the following model “formula” argument for the <code>lm</code> function: <code>amount ~ 1 + Lot:hrs</code>. It may not be clear exactly what kind of model this specifies, but you can deduce the model from the output from <code>summary</code>. Estimate this model and give the parameter estimates and their standard errors using the <code>summary</code> function. Also plot the model with the raw data like you did with the previous model. This model can be written as <span class="math display">\[
  E(Y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \beta_2x_{i2} + \beta_3x_{i3},

Explain how <span class="math inline">\(x_{i1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_{i2}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x_{i3}\)</span> are defined for this model (i.e., how would you determine their values for a given device). Write the model case-wise to show how the expected amount of hormone remaining can be written as a function of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span>, and hours of use for each lot. Use the <code>contrast</code> function to estimate (a) the expected amount of hormone remaining in devices from each lot after zero hours of use, and after 200 hours of use, and (b) the change in the expected amount of hormone for a one hour increase in the amount of use for each lot. Compare these estimates to the parameter estimates from <code>summary</code>, and briefly discuss how one would interpret the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span> in terms of the relationship between expected hormone remaining as a function of lot and hours of use. <strong>Note</strong>: This problem is <em>extra credit</em> for students enrolled in Stat 436, but is <em>required</em> for students enrolled in Stat 516.</p></li>

<li id="fn6"><p>The concept of “population mean” is used more often in introductory classes where the population might be viewed as a real or conceptual set of observations. In a survey it might refer to a large but finite collection of things on which we make observations. But in an observational study like this the populations are perhaps best thought of as the hypothetical and infinite set of observations from which we are “sampling” when we make our observations.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Using this “pooled” estimate assumes that the “population variance” of humerus length is the same for both populations (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_y^2 = \sigma_n^2\)</span>). An alternative approach (sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test">Welch’s <em>t</em>-test</a>) that does not make this assumption replaces <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> with <span class="math display">\[
\sqrt{s_y^2/n_y + s_n^2/n_n},
\]</span> and modifies the degrees of freedom. This approach is also often covered in introductory statistics courses. The linear models we are using now assume that the variance stays constant and so is consistent with the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_y^2 = \sigma_n^2\)</span>, but we will later discuss how to deal with situations where this assumption is not reasonable.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>In an introductory statistics class you would have learned how to compute a confidence interval for a single population mean as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y} \pm ts/\sqrt{n}\)</span>. Here we are essentially doing the same thing, except for each group, and replacing <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(s_p\)</span> and using a degrees of freedom of <span class="math inline">\(n_y + n_n - 2\)</span>.

<li id="fn10"><p>For students familiar with survey sampling theory, the estimators of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> being used here are equivalent to estimators used for stratified random sampling designs. The standard errors, however, are not quite the same. The main reason is that here we are implicitly assuming that the population variances in each layer (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_t\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_h\)</span>) are equal, which is usually not assumed in stratified random sampling. We will learn how to relax this assumption later. Another issue is that we are not taking into account sampling without replacement from a finite population, but given the large volume of each layer relative to the number of liters sampled any such correction would be negligible.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn14"><p>People sometimes confuse these estimates with the means that would be obtained by simply averaging the observations within each level of each each factor. These are the same only if the number of observations in each combination of levels that are averaged are <em>equal</em>. Otherwise they will depend on the sample sizes, which is usually undesirable. However in some cases people will estimate marginal means as weighted averages in observational studies to reflect the relative number of units in each combination of levels within a population.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
